Hi, I'm Akshit - a budding AI enthusiast with skills in prompt engineering, generative AI, deep learning, MLOps, full-stack development, etc 😄. When I'm not working on fun projects like CupcakeAGI 🧁🤖, GPT-4 Controlled God Of War💪🪓 or an anime style John Wick 🔫🕴, I enjoy sharing my knowledge through my silly and fun-filled ML blogs. 😄📚 Excited to collaborate and learn from fellow AI enthusiasts to keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible in this exciting field! 🚀
