Hi, I'm Akshit - a budding AI enthusiast with skills in prompt engineering, generative AI, deep learning, MLOps, full-stack development, etc. When I'm not working on fun projects like CupcakeAGI, GPT-4 Controlled God Of War, I enjoy sharing my knowledge through my silly and fun-filled ML blogs. Excited to collaborate and learn from fellow AI enthusiasts to keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible in this exciting field!
