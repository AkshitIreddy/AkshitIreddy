Hi I'm Akshit👋, a 2nd year student in Btech Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence 🤖 at MIT Bengaluru. I am familiar with the core ideas & fundamentals of Deep Learning, Machine Learning & Data Analysis and have done a few hands on projects 👨‍💻 in these fields. I have a deep passion for technology and am constantly seeking out new ways to learn about the latest developments in the industry.🚀

Whether it's diving into the latest AI research 📜 from companies like Google, Meta, Openai etc., or exploring new approaches and other technological challenges, I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and expand my skillset. 🧰🔧

I am actively pursuing self-directed learning in expanding my knowledge in this field and other areas like cloud computing, cyber security, game development, ar, vr etc. I know that I still have much to learn, but I am eager to continue growing and expanding my skillset as I pursue my career in this exciting field. ✨
